ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Loren

Computer games have been a passion of mine from an early age. I still remember the Christmas I unwrapped my Sega Mega Drive and the hours I spent embodying a little blue hedgehog on screen.

As I have grown older and experienced the innovations & advancements in video game technology, I began to see games differently. I soon realised the desire I had to build worlds and create stories was something I wanted to pursue further.

And so, in 2019, I made the decision to return to education to achieve my goal of a career in the games industry.

As a family man, with a wife and two children aged 6 and 2, I could not have done this without their support. I find having children keeps my imagination alive and they are a good reminder that sometimes we all need to have fun.
